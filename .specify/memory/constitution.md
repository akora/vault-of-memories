# Vault of Memories Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First (SF)

Every solution MUST choose the simplest approach that meets requirements. Complex solutions require explicit justification demonstrating why simpler alternatives are insufficient. Default to plain text, standard formats, and well-established libraries over custom implementations.

**Rationale**: Digital preservation requires longevity, and simple solutions outlast complex ones. Simple code is easier to maintain, debug, and migrate across decades.

### II. Dependency Minimalism (DM)

External dependencies MUST be minimized and each dependency MUST be justified. Prefer Python standard library over third-party packages. When external libraries are used, they MUST be widely adopted, actively maintained, and have stable APIs.

**Rationale**: Dependencies introduce failure points and maintenance overhead. Fewer dependencies mean fewer vulnerabilities, easier installation, and better long-term stability.

### III. Industry Standards Adherence (ISA)

Implementation MUST follow established industry conventions for file formats, metadata standards, and directory structures. Use standard MIME types, EXIF specifications, ID3 tags, and widely-recognized folder hierarchies.

**Rationale**: Standards ensure interoperability with other tools and systems. Following conventions makes the output usable across different platforms and future-proofs the digital vault.

### IV. Test-Driven Thinking (TDT)

All code MUST be designed for testability from the outset. Write tests before implementation where possible. Every public interface MUST have corresponding tests. Test coverage MUST be comprehensive, not just metric-driven.

**Rationale**: Digital preservation systems cannot afford data loss or corruption. Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and provides confidence during maintenance and updates.

### V. Strategic Documentation (SD)

Code MUST be self-documenting through clear naming and structure. External documentation is required only for complex business logic, configuration examples, and user-facing guides. Avoid redundant documentation that duplicates what the code already expresses.

**Rationale**: Self-documenting code scales better than maintained documentation. Strategic documentation focuses effort where it provides maximum value.

### VI. Readability Priority (RP)

Code MUST be immediately understandable to new developers. Favor explicit over implicit. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and modules. Code structure MUST reflect the problem domain clearly.

**Rationale**: Family memory projects often span decades and may be maintained by different people over time. Readable code ensures continuity and reduces maintenance burden.

## Digital Preservation Standards

File processing MUST preserve original data integrity. All operations MUST be reversible or provide clear audit trails. Metadata extraction MUST not modify source files. Generated filenames MUST be human-readable and contain sufficient metadata for organization without requiring database lookups.

**Rationale**: The primary goal is digital preservation. Any processing that risks data loss or reduces long-term accessibility violates the core mission.

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

All features MUST follow the spec-kit workflow: `/constitution` → `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`. Each phase MUST complete successfully before proceeding to the next. Constitution compliance MUST be verified at each gate.

**Rationale**: Structured development ensures quality and maintains consistency across features. The constitution serves as the foundation for all development decisions.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Violations require explicit justification and approval. Amendments follow semantic versioning and require clear migration plans for existing code.

Constitution compliance gates are enforced at:

- Feature specification phase (requirements alignment)
- Implementation planning phase (technical approach review)
- Code review phase (principle adherence verification)

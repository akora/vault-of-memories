# Feature Specification: Digital Vault Pre-processor

**Feature Branch**: `001-vault-preprocessor`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a digital vault pre-processor system that takes a set of files as input and after analysis, deduplication, metadata extraction and renaming moves them to a vault organized by content type and date with human-readable, metadata-rich filenames."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature description provided: Digital vault pre-processor
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Users with digital files to organize
   → Actions: Analyze, deduplicate, extract metadata, rename, organize
   → Data: Digital files (photos, documents, videos, audio, etc.)
   → Constraints: Preserve original timestamps, ensure uniqueness
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clearly defined in requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: Input files → Processing → Organized vault
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (files, metadata, vault structure)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   → No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user who wants to preserve digital memories for my family, I need a system that can take my scattered collection of digital files (photos, documents, videos, etc.) and organize them into a structured digital vault with consistent naming and organization, so that my family can easily navigate and understand the contents decades from now.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a folder containing mixed digital files, **When** I run the pre-processor, **Then** all files are organized into content-type folders with date-based hierarchy and metadata-rich filenames
2. **Given** duplicate files in the input, **When** processing occurs, **Then** duplicates are identified and moved to a separate duplicates folder while preserving the original
3. **Given** files with EXIF metadata, **When** processing photos, **Then** camera information and original timestamps are extracted and included in the filename
4. **Given** corrupted or unsupported files, **When** processing encounters them, **Then** they are moved to appropriate quarantine folders with error categorization
5. **Given** files without clear metadata, **When** processing occurs, **Then** fallback mechanisms use filename patterns and filesystem timestamps

### Edge Cases
- What happens when filename length exceeds system limits? (Truncate while preserving uniqueness)
- How does system handle files with no creation date? (Use filesystem timestamps as fallback)
- What occurs when vault destination already contains files with same name? (Append counter to ensure uniqueness)
- How are timezone differences handled? (Preserve original timestamps without UTC conversion)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept single files, multiple files, or nested folder structures as input
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate SHA-256 checksums for duplicate detection across entire vault
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract metadata from files using content analysis (EXIF, ID3, document properties)
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate human-readable filenames containing creation date, time, and relevant metadata
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize files into content-type folders with YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD date hierarchy
- **FR-006**: System MUST distinguish photos from images based on camera EXIF metadata presence
- **FR-007**: System MUST classify PDFs as brochures (≤5 pages) or ebooks (>5 pages)
- **FR-008**: System MUST standardize manufacturer names using configurable mapping
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve original creation timestamps without timezone conversion
- **FR-010**: System MUST move duplicate files to separate folder while preserving original path structure
- **FR-011**: System MUST quarantine corrupted, unsupported, or problematic files by error type
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure filename uniqueness across entire vault using counters when needed
- **FR-013**: System MUST support batch processing without requiring continuous monitoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when primary metadata sources are unavailable
- **FR-015**: System MUST remove system/hidden files during processing
- **FR-016**: System MUST track processing history in persistent storage
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate processing summary reports
- **FR-018**: System MUST support manual triggering via script execution

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Digital File**: Input file with original path, content, metadata, and checksum
- **Processed File**: File with extracted metadata, generated filename, and vault destination path
- **Vault Structure**: Organized hierarchy of content-type folders with date-based subfolders
- **Metadata**: Extracted information including timestamps, device info, dimensions, duration, page count
- **Processing Record**: History entry with original path, checksum, vault path, and processing timestamp
- **Duplicate Entry**: Record linking duplicate files to their original vault location
- **Quarantine Entry**: Record of problematic files with error categorization and original path

# Feature Specification: Configuration Management System

**Feature Branch**: `002-configuration-system`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "002-configuration-system Build a configuration management system that loads and validates JSON configuration files for the vault processor. The system provides centralized access to settings, filename rules, classification rules, processing rules, and manufacturer mappings. It validates configuration integrity and handles configuration updates."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A system administrator wants to customize how the vault processor handles different file types, naming conventions, and organization rules. They need to modify configuration files to add new camera manufacturers, update filename patterns, or change folder classification rules without requiring code changes or system restarts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh installation, **When** the system starts, **Then** it loads default configuration files and validates all settings successfully
2. **Given** a custom filename rule configuration, **When** the system processes files, **Then** it applies the configured naming patterns correctly
3. **Given** an invalid configuration file, **When** the system attempts to load it, **Then** it provides clear error messages indicating the validation failures
4. **Given** updated manufacturer mappings, **When** the configuration is reloaded, **Then** new camera models are recognized without system restart

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration files are missing or corrupted?
- How does system handle conflicting rules within the same configuration?
- What happens when configuration files have syntax errors?
- How does system behave when configuration files are locked or read-only?
- What happens when required configuration sections are missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load configuration from well-structured, hierarchical configuration files
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate configuration integrity at load time and reject invalid configurations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide centralized access to all configuration settings throughout the application
- **FR-004**: System MUST support filename generation rules that can be customized without code changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain file classification rules that determine folder organization
- **FR-006**: System MUST support processing rules that define how different file types are handled
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain manufacturer mappings for camera, phone, and device identification
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configuration updates without requiring application restart
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages when configuration validation fails
- **FR-010**: System MUST support default configuration values when custom settings are not provided
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent configuration changes that would compromise data integrity
- **FR-012**: System MUST log configuration loading and validation events for troubleshooting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration Schema**: Defines the structure and validation rules for all configuration files
- **Settings Collection**: Central repository of all loaded configuration values accessible to other components
- **Filename Rules**: Configurable patterns and templates for generating descriptive filenames
- **Classification Rules**: Logic for determining file categories and folder placement
- **Processing Rules**: Instructions for handling different file types and formats
- **Manufacturer Mappings**: Database of device manufacturers and model identification patterns
- **Validation Engine**: Component that verifies configuration integrity and reports errors

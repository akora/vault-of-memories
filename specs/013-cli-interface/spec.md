# Feature Specification: CLI Interface

**Feature Branch**: `013-cli-interface`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "013-cli-interface Build a command-line interface that orchestrates the entire vault processing pipeline. The system coordinates all processing modules, provides progress feedback, generates processing summaries, handles global error reporting, and allows manual triggering of the processing workflow."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants a simple command-line tool to process their digital files into an organized vault. They need to point the tool at source files or folders, monitor processing progress, understand what happened during processing, and receive clear feedback about successes, errors, and the final organization of their digital collection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a folder of mixed files, **When** user runs the vault processor command, **Then** the system processes all files and provides a summary of results
2. **Given** processing is running, **When** user checks status, **Then** the system shows real-time progress with file counts and current operations
3. **Given** processing completes with some errors, **When** user reviews output, **Then** the system provides detailed error report with clear next steps
4. **Given** user wants to reprocess quarantined files, **When** they run recovery command, **Then** the system attempts reprocessing and reports outcomes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user interrupts processing midway (Ctrl+C)?
- How does system handle very large file collections that might take hours to process?
- What happens when user runs multiple instances simultaneously?
- How does system handle insufficient permissions for source or destination folders?
- What happens when available disk space is insufficient for the operation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a command-line interface that orchestrates the complete vault processing pipeline
- **FR-002**: System MUST coordinate execution of all processing modules in the correct sequence
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide real-time progress feedback showing current operations and completion status
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate comprehensive processing summaries with statistics and outcomes
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle global error reporting and provide actionable error information to users
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow manual triggering of the processing workflow with configurable parameters
- **FR-007**: System MUST support graceful interruption and cleanup when processing is terminated
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide command-line options for common configuration settings and operational modes
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate input parameters and source locations before beginning processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both interactive and batch processing modes for different use cases
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide help documentation and usage examples accessible from the command line
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure proper resource cleanup and status reporting even when operations fail

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Processing Pipeline**: Orchestrated sequence of all vault processing modules with dependency management
- **Progress Monitor**: Real-time tracking of processing status, file counts, and operation progress
- **Command Parser**: Handles command-line arguments, options, and validation of user input
- **Summary Generator**: Creates comprehensive reports of processing outcomes and statistics
- **Error Aggregator**: Collects and presents errors from all processing components in unified format
- **Resource Manager**: Monitors system resources and ensures proper cleanup of operations

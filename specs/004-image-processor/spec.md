# Feature Specification: Image Processor

**Feature Branch**: `004-image-processor`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "004-image-processor Build an image processor that handles both photos and graphics. The system extracts EXIF data using Pillow to distinguish camera photos from other images, extracts resolution and camera information, determines raw vs processed classification based on file extensions, and preserves original creation timestamps."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has a mixed collection of image files including family photos taken with cameras and phones, screenshots, downloaded graphics, and scanned documents. They need the vault system to intelligently organize these images by distinguishing actual photographs from other graphics, extracting camera information when available, and preserving the original timestamps that mark when memories were created.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JPEG photo with EXIF data from a Canon camera, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts camera model, creation date, and resolution, classifying it as a camera photo
2. **Given** a PNG screenshot with no EXIF data, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it classifies it as a graphic rather than a photo and uses file timestamps
3. **Given** a RAW file (.CR2, .NEF), **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it classifies it as raw format and extracts available camera metadata
4. **Given** an image with corrupted EXIF data, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it handles the corruption gracefully and extracts what metadata is available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when image files have EXIF data but no camera information?
- How does system handle images with GPS coordinates that might need privacy consideration?
- What happens when image resolution cannot be determined?
- How does system handle very large image files that might impact processing time?
- What happens when image files are password protected or encrypted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract EXIF metadata from all image formats that support embedded data
- **FR-002**: System MUST distinguish between camera photos and other graphics based on EXIF data presence and camera information
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract camera make, model, and settings when available in metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST determine image resolution and dimensions for all processed images
- **FR-005**: System MUST classify images as raw or processed based on file extension and format analysis
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve and extract original creation timestamps from image metadata
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle images without EXIF data by using file system timestamps
- **FR-008**: System MUST support all common image formats including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, WebP, and RAW formats
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle corrupted or incomplete EXIF data without failing processing
- **FR-010**: System MUST extract GPS coordinates when present while maintaining user privacy controls
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain image quality and avoid unnecessary recompression during analysis
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide standardized metadata output regardless of original image format

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image Metadata Record**: Contains extracted EXIF data, camera information, timestamps, and classification
- **Camera Information**: Manufacturer, model, lens details, and capture settings extracted from EXIF
- **Resolution Data**: Image dimensions, DPI, color depth, and format specifications
- **Timestamp Collection**: Original creation date, modification dates, and file system timestamps
- **Classification Result**: Determination of photo vs graphic, raw vs processed, and content category
- **EXIF Parser**: Component responsible for safely extracting metadata from various image formats

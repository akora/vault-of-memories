# Feature Specification: Organization Manager

**Feature Branch**: `010-organization-manager`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "010-organization-manager Build an organization manager that determines final file placement in the vault structure. The system applies content classification rules, creates date-based folder hierarchy (YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD), ensures folder structure consistency, and handles edge cases in file classification."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants their digital vault organized in a logical, consistent structure where files are automatically placed in appropriate folders based on content type and creation date. They need the system to create a predictable hierarchy that makes files easy to find, whether they're looking for family photos from a specific month or documents from a particular year.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a family photo taken on December 25, 2023, **When** the organization manager processes it, **Then** it places the file in "vault/photos/family/2023/2023-12/2023-12-25/"
2. **Given** a PDF document created on January 15, 2024, **When** the organization manager processes it, **Then** it places the file in "vault/documents/office/2024/2024-01/2024-01-15/"
3. **Given** a video with unclear classification, **When** the organization manager processes it, **Then** it applies fallback rules and places it in an appropriate default category
4. **Given** a file with no date metadata, **When** the organization manager processes it, **Then** it uses fallback date sources and creates the appropriate folder structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when file creation date spans multiple timezones?
- How does system handle files that could fit into multiple content categories?
- What happens when date metadata is completely missing or corrupted?
- How does system handle vault folder creation permissions issues?
- What happens when folder structure depth limits are reached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST apply content classification rules to determine primary file category (photos, documents, videos, audio)
- **FR-002**: System MUST create date-based folder hierarchy using YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD format
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure consistent folder structure across all content types in the vault
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle edge cases in file classification using configurable fallback rules
- **FR-005**: System MUST create folder paths automatically when they don't exist in the vault structure
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate folder names for filesystem compatibility across different operating systems
- **FR-007**: System MUST support subcategory classification within main content types (family photos, work documents, etc.)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle files with multiple possible classifications by applying priority rules
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide organization preview showing proposed file placement before execution
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain folder structure consistency even when processing files in parallel
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle special vault folders (duplicates, quarantine) with appropriate organization rules
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all organization decisions and folder creation activities for audit purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Vault Structure Definition**: Hierarchical organization rules defining content categories and date-based folder patterns
- **Classification Decision**: Determination of file category, subcategory, and final placement path
- **Folder Creation Engine**: Component responsible for creating directory structures with proper permissions
- **Content Classification Rules**: Configurable logic for determining file categories based on type and metadata
- **Date Hierarchy Manager**: Handles creation and validation of date-based folder structures
- **Organization Audit Log**: Records all placement decisions and folder operations for traceability

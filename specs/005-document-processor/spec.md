# Feature Specification: Document Processor

**Feature Branch**: `005-document-processor`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "005-document-processor Build a document processor that handles various document formats including PDFs, Office documents, and text files. The system counts PDF pages to classify documents as brochures (‚â§5 pages) or ebooks (>5 pages), extracts document metadata like creation date and author, and handles OCR content matching for scanned documents."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has accumulated various digital documents over the years including family records, receipts, manuals, ebooks, and scanned papers. They need the vault system to intelligently organize these documents by automatically classifying them based on content and length, extracting important metadata like creation dates and authors, and properly handling both digital-native and scanned documents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a 3-page PDF manual, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it classifies it as a brochure and extracts creation date and author metadata
2. **Given** a 50-page PDF ebook, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it classifies it as an ebook and organizes it accordingly
3. **Given** a Word document with author and creation metadata, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts all available document properties
4. **Given** a scanned PDF with OCR text content, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it identifies it as a scanned document and handles content extraction appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF page count cannot be determined due to corruption?
- How does system handle password-protected documents?
- What happens when document metadata is missing or corrupted?
- How does system handle very large documents that might impact processing time?
- What happens when OCR content is unreadable or contains garbled text?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support processing of PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and plain text document formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST count pages in PDF documents to determine classification criteria
- **FR-003**: System MUST classify PDF documents as brochures (5 pages or fewer) or ebooks (more than 5 pages)
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract document metadata including creation date, modification date, author, and title
- **FR-005**: System MUST identify scanned documents versus digital-native documents
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle OCR content extraction and text matching for scanned documents
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract document properties from Office formats (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle documents with missing or incomplete metadata gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and handle password-protected documents without compromising security
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide document classification results for routing to appropriate folder structures
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain document integrity during metadata extraction without modifying original files
- **FR-012**: System MUST log document processing results and any extraction errors for troubleshooting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document Metadata Record**: Contains extracted properties, page count, classification, and processing status
- **Document Classification**: Categorization as brochure, ebook, office document, or scanned document
- **Page Analysis Result**: Page count, document structure, and content type determination
- **OCR Content Data**: Extracted text content from scanned documents with confidence levels
- **Author Information**: Creator, last modified by, and document ownership details
- **Document Properties**: Title, subject, keywords, creation timestamps, and application metadata

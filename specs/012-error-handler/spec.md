# Feature Specification: Error Handler

**Feature Branch**: `012-error-handler`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "012-error-handler Build an error handler that provides centralized error management across all processing components. The system logs errors with context, moves problematic files to categorized quarantine folders (corrupted, unsupported, processing-errors), generates error reports, and handles recovery scenarios."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to understand what happened to files that couldn't be processed successfully and have confidence that no data was lost during vault processing. They need clear error reports, properly categorized problematic files, and the ability to address issues and reprocess files when problems are resolved.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a corrupted image file during processing, **When** an error occurs, **Then** the system moves it to quarantine/corrupted with detailed error logs
2. **Given** an unsupported file format, **When** processing fails, **Then** the system categorizes it in quarantine/unsupported and logs the format details
3. **Given** multiple processing errors across different components, **When** processing completes, **Then** the system generates a comprehensive error report with actionable information
4. **Given** files in quarantine that have been fixed, **When** recovery is initiated, **Then** the system can reprocess them through the normal pipeline

### Edge Cases
- What happens when quarantine directories cannot be created or accessed?
- How does system handle cascading errors across multiple processing components?
- What happens when error logging itself fails due to disk space or permissions?
- How does system handle very large files that cause memory or timeout errors?
- What happens when the same file repeatedly fails processing in different ways?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide centralized error management that all processing components can utilize
- **FR-002**: System MUST log errors with complete context including component, file path, timestamp, and error details
- **FR-003**: System MUST categorize problematic files into quarantine subfolders: corrupted, unsupported, and processing-errors
- **FR-004**: System MUST move problematic files to appropriate quarantine locations while preserving original file integrity
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate comprehensive error reports summarizing all issues encountered during processing
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide recovery mechanisms to reprocess quarantined files when issues are resolved
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain error severity levels to distinguish between critical failures and minor issues
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent cascading failures from stopping the entire processing pipeline
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide error notification capabilities for immediate attention to critical issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain error statistics and trends for system health monitoring
- **FR-011**: System MUST support error escalation procedures for unrecoverable failures
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure error handling operations do not consume excessive system resources

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Error Record**: Comprehensive log entry containing error details, context, component information, and resolution status
- **Quarantine Manager**: Handles categorization and placement of problematic files with proper organization
- **Error Report Generator**: Creates human-readable summaries of processing issues and their resolutions
- **Recovery Engine**: Manages reprocessing of quarantined files when underlying issues are addressed
- **Error Classification System**: Categorizes errors by type, severity, and appropriate handling procedures
- **Notification Manager**: Handles alert distribution for critical errors requiring immediate attention

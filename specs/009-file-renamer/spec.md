# Feature Specification: File Renamer

**Feature Branch**: `009-file-renamer`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "009-file-renamer Build a file renamer that generates standardized, human-readable filenames using extracted metadata. The system applies configurable naming patterns with metadata components (date, time, size, resolution, etc.), ensures filename uniqueness across the vault, handles filename length limits, and uses 8-digit padding for counters."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants their digital vault to have consistent, descriptive filenames that make files easily identifiable without requiring additional database lookups. They need the system to generate meaningful names using metadata like dates, camera models, resolution, and file characteristics while ensuring every filename is unique and follows filesystem constraints.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a camera photo with EXIF metadata, **When** the renamer processes it, **Then** it generates a filename like "20231225-143022-Nikon-D5100-ir4928x3264-s2847291.jpg"
2. **Given** two identical photos taken at the same second, **When** the renamer processes them, **Then** it ensures uniqueness by adding counters like "...s2847291-00000001.jpg" and "...s2847291-00000002.jpg"
3. **Given** a generated filename that exceeds filesystem limits, **When** the renamer processes it, **Then** it truncates components intelligently while preserving essential metadata
4. **Given** a file with missing metadata, **When** the renamer processes it, **Then** it generates a filename using available information and fills gaps with default patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metadata contains characters invalid for filenames?
- How does system handle files where all metadata components are missing?
- What happens when the generated filename conflicts with an existing file in the vault?
- How does system handle extremely long camera model names or metadata values?
- What happens when date/time metadata is corrupted or invalid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate human-readable filenames using extracted metadata components
- **FR-002**: System MUST apply configurable naming patterns that can be customized for different file types
- **FR-003**: System MUST incorporate date, time, device information, resolution, and file size into generated names
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure filename uniqueness across the entire vault using collision detection
- **FR-005**: System MUST use 8-digit zero-padded counters for resolving filename conflicts
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle filesystem filename length limitations by intelligent truncation
- **FR-007**: System MUST sanitize metadata to remove or replace invalid filename characters
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve file extensions and maintain format association
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide fallback naming strategies when metadata is insufficient
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain consistent naming patterns within file categories
- **FR-011**: System MUST support preview mode to show proposed filenames before applying changes
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all renaming operations with original and new filenames for audit purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Naming Pattern Template**: Configurable format strings defining how metadata components are assembled into filenames
- **Filename Generation Result**: Generated filename with metadata mapping and uniqueness verification
- **Collision Detection Registry**: Tracks existing filenames to prevent duplicates across the vault
- **Metadata Component Sanitizer**: Handles cleaning and formatting of metadata values for filename use
- **Truncation Strategy**: Rules for intelligently shortening filenames while preserving essential information
- **Filename Audit Record**: Historical log of all renaming operations for traceability and rollback

# Feature Specification: Metadata Extractor

**Feature Branch**: `008-metadata-extractor`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "008-metadata-extractor Build a metadata extractor that coordinates between specialized processors and consolidates metadata from multiple sources. The system applies metadata priority rules (EXIF > filename > filesystem), handles timezone preservation without UTC conversion, and standardizes manufacturer names using configurable mappings."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has files with metadata scattered across different sources - some have rich EXIF data, others have meaningful filenames, and some only have filesystem timestamps. They need the vault system to intelligently consolidate this information using priority rules while preserving original timezones and standardizing manufacturer names for consistent organization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a photo with EXIF data and a descriptive filename, **When** the extractor processes it, **Then** it prioritizes EXIF metadata over filename information
2. **Given** multiple metadata sources with conflicting timestamps, **When** the extractor consolidates them, **Then** it applies priority rules (EXIF > filename > filesystem) to determine authoritative values
3. **Given** a file with timezone-specific timestamp, **When** the extractor processes it, **Then** it preserves the original timezone without converting to UTC
4. **Given** a camera file with manufacturer "NIKON CORPORATION", **When** the extractor processes it, **Then** it standardizes the name to "Nikon" using configurable mappings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metadata from different sources has completely contradictory information?
- How does system handle files with no metadata from any source?
- What happens when timezone information is missing or invalid?
- How does system handle manufacturer names not found in the mapping configuration?
- What happens when the consolidation process encounters corrupted metadata?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST coordinate between specialized processors (image, document, audio, video) to gather metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST consolidate metadata from multiple sources including EXIF, filenames, and filesystem attributes
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply priority rules with EXIF data taking precedence over filename, which takes precedence over filesystem data
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve original timezone information without converting timestamps to UTC
- **FR-005**: System MUST standardize manufacturer names using configurable mapping rules
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle conflicting metadata by applying documented resolution strategies
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a unified metadata record regardless of original file type or source
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain audit trail showing which metadata came from which source
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle missing metadata gracefully without failing the consolidation process
- **FR-010**: System MUST support custom priority rules through configuration for different metadata fields
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate metadata consistency and flag potential conflicts for review
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide metadata quality scores indicating confidence and completeness levels

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Consolidated Metadata Record**: Unified metadata structure containing information from all sources with priority resolution
- **Metadata Source Registry**: Tracks which specialized processor provided each piece of metadata
- **Priority Resolution Engine**: Applies configurable rules to resolve conflicts between metadata sources
- **Manufacturer Mapping Table**: Configurable translations for standardizing device manufacturer names
- **Timezone Preservation Handler**: Maintains original timezone context without UTC conversion
- **Metadata Quality Assessment**: Confidence scores and completeness indicators for consolidated results

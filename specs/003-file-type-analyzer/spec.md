# Feature Specification: File Type Analyzer

**Feature Branch**: `003-file-type-analyzer`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "003-file-type-analyzer Build a file type analyzer that uses python-magic for MIME type detection to definitively identify file types based on content rather than extensions. The system validates file extensions against actual content and routes files to appropriate specialized processors based on detected type."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has a collection of files with incorrect, missing, or misleading file extensions. They need the vault system to accurately identify each file's true content type to ensure proper processing, organization, and metadata extraction regardless of what the filename extension claims the file to be.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a JPEG image file with a .txt extension, **When** the analyzer processes it, **Then** it correctly identifies it as an image and routes to image processor
2. **Given** a collection of files with various extensions, **When** the analyzer processes them, **Then** it validates each extension matches the actual content type
3. **Given** a corrupted file that appears to be a PDF, **When** the analyzer examines it, **Then** it detects the corruption and routes to error handling
4. **Given** a file with no extension, **When** the analyzer processes it, **Then** it determines the correct type from content and assigns appropriate processor

### Edge Cases
- What happens when file content is completely unrecognizable or corrupted?
- How does system handle files that match multiple possible content types?
- What happens when file headers are present but content is truncated?
- How does system handle very large files that may impact analysis performance?
- What happens when file content doesn't match any known type patterns?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze file content to determine true file type regardless of file extension
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that file extensions match actual file content
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and report files with mismatched extensions and content
- **FR-004**: System MUST route files to appropriate specialized processors based on detected content type
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle files with missing or no file extensions
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify corrupted files that cannot be properly typed
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all major file types including images, documents, audio, video, and archives
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide confidence levels for file type detection when content is ambiguous
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain a registry of supported file types and their processing requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle binary and text files appropriately during content analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST process file type analysis efficiently without loading entire file contents into memory
- **FR-012**: System MUST log file type detection results and confidence levels for audit purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File Type Detection Result**: Contains detected MIME type, confidence level, and extension validation status
- **Content Type Registry**: Maintains mapping between detected types and appropriate processor assignments
- **Extension Validator**: Compares file extensions against detected content types to identify mismatches
- **Processor Router**: Directs files to appropriate specialized processors based on analysis results
- **Analysis Engine**: Core component that examines file content to determine type
- **Corruption Detector**: Identifies files with damaged or incomplete content that cannot be reliably processed

# Feature Specification: Audio Processor

**Feature Branch**: `006-audio-processor`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "006-audio-processor Build an audio processor that extracts ID3 tags and metadata from audio files using mutagen. The system gets duration, bitrate, and format information, extracts artist, album, and creation date information, and handles various audio formats consistently."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has a music collection spanning decades with files in various formats including MP3s, FLACs, M4As, and other audio formats. They need the vault system to extract detailed metadata from these audio files to enable proper organization by artist, album, and creation date while preserving technical information like quality and duration for future reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an MP3 file with complete ID3 tags, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts artist, album, title, year, duration, and bitrate information
2. **Given** a FLAC file with embedded metadata, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts all available metadata in a standardized format
3. **Given** an audio file with missing metadata, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts available technical information and handles missing tags gracefully
4. **Given** a collection of mixed audio formats, **When** the processor analyzes them, **Then** it provides consistent metadata structure regardless of original format

### Edge Cases
- What happens when audio files have corrupted or unreadable metadata?
- How does system handle audio files with multiple metadata formats (ID3v1 vs ID3v2)?
- What happens when audio files are very large and might impact processing time?
- How does system handle audio files with special characters in metadata?
- What happens when audio files have incomplete or missing duration information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract ID3 tags and metadata from all supported audio formats
- **FR-002**: System MUST support MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, WMA, and other common audio formats
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract audio duration, bitrate, sample rate, and format information
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract artist, album, title, track number, and genre information when available
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract creation date, release year, and recording date information
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle multiple metadata tag formats consistently (ID3v1, ID3v2, Vorbis comments)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide standardized metadata output regardless of original audio format
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle audio files with missing or incomplete metadata gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST extract album artwork and cover image information when embedded
- **FR-010**: System MUST determine audio quality classification based on bitrate and format
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve original metadata integrity without modifying audio files
- **FR-012**: System MUST log metadata extraction results and any processing errors for troubleshooting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Audio Metadata Record**: Contains extracted tags, technical specifications, and classification information
- **Track Information**: Artist, album, title, track number, genre, and release details
- **Technical Specifications**: Duration, bitrate, sample rate, channels, and format details
- **Timestamp Data**: Creation date, release year, recording date, and file modification times
- **Album Artwork**: Embedded cover images and artwork metadata when available
- **Quality Classification**: Audio quality rating based on bitrate, format, and compression type

# Feature Specification: File Ingestion System

**Feature Branch**: `001-file-ingestion`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a file ingestion system that accepts single files, multiple files, or nested folder structures as input. The system calculates SHA-256 checksums for each file and checks for duplicates against an SQLite database. It removes system/hidden files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db) during cleanup and routes non-duplicate files to the next processing stage."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to begin organizing their scattered digital files by feeding them into the digital vault system. They point the system at a folder containing family photos, documents, and videos (including nested subfolders) and expect the system to accept all valid files while automatically removing duplicates and unwanted system files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a single JPG file, **When** user submits it for ingestion, **Then** system calculates SHA-256 checksum and accepts file for processing
2. **Given** a folder with 100 mixed files, **When** user submits the folder, **Then** system processes all files recursively and reports counts of accepted/rejected/duplicate files
3. **Given** two identical files in different locations, **When** both are submitted, **Then** system identifies them as duplicates and processes only the first one
4. **Given** a folder containing .DS_Store files, **When** user submits it, **Then** system automatically removes system files before processing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a file is corrupted and cannot be read for checksum calculation?
- How does system handle extremely large files that might impact processing time?
- What happens when the SQLite database is locked or inaccessible?
- How does system handle symbolic links in the folder structure?
- What happens when file permissions prevent reading a file?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept single files as input through a standardized interface
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept multiple files simultaneously through batch processing
- **FR-003**: System MUST recursively process nested folder structures without depth limits
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate SHA-256 checksums for every processed file
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain a persistent record of file checksums for duplicate detection
- **FR-006**: System MUST identify duplicate files by comparing SHA-256 checksums
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically remove known system/hidden files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, .tmp files)
- **FR-008**: System MUST route non-duplicate, clean files to the next processing stage
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear feedback on processing results (counts of processed/duplicated/removed files)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle file access errors gracefully without stopping batch processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve original file modification timestamps during processing
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain processing logs for audit and troubleshooting purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **File Record**: Represents a processed file with checksum, path, size, timestamps, and processing status
- **Duplicate Detection Database**: Persistent storage of file checksums and metadata for duplicate identification
- **Processing Queue**: Temporary collection of files awaiting checksum calculation and validation
- **System File Filter**: Configuration defining patterns for system/hidden files to be removed

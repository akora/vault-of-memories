# Feature Specification: File Mover

**Feature Branch**: `011-file-mover`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "011-file-mover Build a file mover that handles final file operations including moving files to vault locations, creating destination directories, handling duplicates and quarantine files, updating database records, and ensuring atomic operations to prevent data loss."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user expects their files to be safely and reliably moved into the organized vault structure without any risk of data loss or corruption. They need the system to handle all edge cases including duplicates, file system errors, and interrupted operations while maintaining database consistency and providing clear status on what happened to each file.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a processed file ready for vault placement, **When** the file mover executes, **Then** it moves the file to the correct location and updates database records atomically
2. **Given** a duplicate file during move operation, **When** the file mover processes it, **Then** it places the duplicate in the duplicates folder and records the relationship
3. **Given** a file that cannot be processed safely, **When** the file mover encounters it, **Then** it places the file in quarantine with detailed error information
4. **Given** an interrupted move operation, **When** the system restarts, **Then** it detects and recovers from partial operations without data loss

### Edge Cases
- What happens when destination directory cannot be created due to permissions?
- How does system handle disk space exhaustion during move operations?
- What happens when database updates fail but file move succeeds?
- How does system handle network interruptions during moves to network storage?
- What happens when multiple files have identical target names in the same location?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST move files to their final vault locations as determined by the organization manager
- **FR-002**: System MUST create destination directories automatically when they don't exist
- **FR-003**: System MUST handle duplicate files by moving them to designated duplicates folder with cross-references
- **FR-004**: System MUST move problematic files to quarantine folder with detailed error logs
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure atomic operations where database updates and file moves succeed or fail together
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve file timestamps, permissions, and attributes during move operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST update database records with final file locations and move status
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide rollback capability for failed move operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle concurrent file operations safely without conflicts
- **FR-010**: System MUST verify file integrity after move operations using checksums
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide detailed operation logs for troubleshooting and audit purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle storage space validation before attempting move operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Move Operation Record**: Tracks source path, destination path, status, and any errors for each file operation
- **Atomic Transaction Manager**: Ensures database and filesystem changes are coordinated and reversible
- **Duplicate Handler**: Manages identification and placement of duplicate files with proper cross-referencing
- **Quarantine Manager**: Handles problematic files with detailed error classification and recovery options
- **Directory Creation Engine**: Safely creates destination folder structures with appropriate permissions
- **Integrity Verification System**: Validates file completeness and checksums after move operations

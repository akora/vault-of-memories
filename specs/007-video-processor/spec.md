# Feature Specification: Video Processor

**Feature Branch**: `007-video-processor`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "007-video-processor Build a video processor that extracts metadata from video files using pymediainfo. The system gets duration, resolution, and fps information, extracts creation date and camera information when available, and determines video categories (family, tutorials, work, tech, etc.) based on content analysis."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has accumulated video files from various sources including family recordings, educational content, work presentations, and technical tutorials. They need the vault system to intelligently extract video characteristics and automatically categorize these videos based on content type to enable efficient organization and retrieval of their digital video collection.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a family vacation video recorded on a smartphone, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts duration, resolution, creation date, and categorizes it as family content
2. **Given** a tutorial video downloaded from the internet, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts technical specifications and categorizes it as educational/tutorial content
3. **Given** a work presentation recording, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts metadata and categorizes it as work-related content
4. **Given** a video with embedded camera metadata, **When** the processor analyzes it, **Then** it extracts camera information along with technical specifications

### Edge Cases
- What happens when video files have corrupted metadata or headers?
- How does system handle very large video files that might impact processing time?
- What happens when video creation date cannot be determined?
- How does system handle videos with multiple audio/video streams?
- What happens when content analysis cannot determine a clear category?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract technical video metadata including duration, resolution, frame rate, and codec information
- **FR-002**: System MUST support common video formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, and WebM
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract creation date and timestamp information when available in metadata
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract camera and device information when embedded in video metadata
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine video categories based on content analysis and metadata patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST classify videos into predefined categories: family, tutorials, work, tech, entertainment, and other
- **FR-007**: System MUST extract video quality indicators including bitrate, compression, and encoding information
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle videos with multiple audio tracks and subtitle streams
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect and extract GPS location data when present in video metadata
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide confidence levels for category determinations when content analysis is ambiguous
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve video integrity during metadata extraction without modifying original files
- **FR-012**: System MUST log video processing results and category assignments for audit and refinement purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Video Metadata Record**: Contains extracted technical specifications, timestamps, and category classification
- **Technical Specifications**: Resolution, duration, frame rate, bitrate, codec, and quality metrics
- **Camera Information**: Device model, recording settings, and capture metadata when available
- **Category Classification**: Content type determination with confidence levels and reasoning
- **Timestamp Collection**: Creation date, modification dates, and embedded temporal metadata
- **Content Analysis Result**: Categorization logic, pattern matching results, and classification confidence
